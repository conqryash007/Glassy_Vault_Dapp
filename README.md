## Project Description <br>
The Glassy Vault Dapp ideate upon the increasing use of fraudulent certificates due to conventional means of storing and verification of degrees/educational papers/caste certificates etc.<br/>
This project aims to provide a way to securely store the results of 10th and 12th board exams of different schools using next gen technology i.e blockchain.
The smart contract build on the <strong>Ethereum</strong> network can surely be a effective way to tackle the above problem and can easily be extended to store more such documents.
